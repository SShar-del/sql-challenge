# sql-challenge

A research project about people whom the company, Pewlett Hackard employed during the 1980s and 1990s. Historical Employee database has only six CSV files from that period.

For this project,  I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then performed data analysis.

## Database Schema Generation 

- Mod9Challenge_Schema sql file - schema based on the Mod9Challenge ERD  

CREATE TABLE commands for tables named as, Title, Employee, Department, Dept_Emp, Dept_Mgr, and Salary.

It also includes the following information: 

- Datatypes for columns defined along with constraints
- Primary keys for all 6 tables  
- Foreign Keys for Dept_Emp, Dept_Mgr, Employee, Salary tables
- Composite key for Dept_Emp table
- NOT NULL Constraints for specific table columns

## Manual CSV Import using Postgres IMPORT/EXPORT Feature

All the 6 table columns were populated with the data in the corresponding CSV file shared as part of the Starter Code for Module 9 Challenge
